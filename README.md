This is a small script to convert a jupyter python notebook to a simple markdown file.
When I started to work on my Parallel Paint article, I was looking for a good markdown editor.
As I could not find one, I decided to use a local Jupyter Notebook server and use my internet browser as a markdown editor, using markdown cells of an python notebook.
